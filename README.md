# Alfred

Everyone needs a helpful assistant. This application is a collection of common commands I need.

## Setup

1) Copy `.envrc.example` to `.envrc` and fill in with correct values (you will need to have 
[direnv](https://direnv.net/) installed).
1) Have a JRE (Java 8 or above).

## Running

1) Run `bin/alfred`.

## Installing

1) Run `bin/install`.
1) This will install alfred to `/usr/local/bin`, so you should be able to just run `alfred` from anywhere.
